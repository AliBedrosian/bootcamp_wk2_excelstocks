McCondichie, Alison - Week 2 HW - Excel Stocks

This project showcases ability to organize and process large amounts of data and create a reusable Module of code to run across multiple sheets. This allowed me to provide more comprehensive and reader friendly insights for eaach stock in a yearly quarter. 

I started with simple tests to see if I could run every process with just one stock. With a few changes of switching hard values with variables that would change and work across multiple rows I was able to expand the code to run across all rows. The credit card class activity was a big help with this. 

To get the code to run across all sheets I created it as a Module in VBA so I could just select and run the Macro in each sheet. Screenshots provided to show how the Macro ran on each sheet. 

My VBA code file is provided in two forms in case one is easier to acccess than the other.
